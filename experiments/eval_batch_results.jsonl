The transition probabilities between states are fixed, and the process is Markovian if the state at time $k$ is determined solely by the state at time $k-1$.\n\nExamples:\n- The Markov chain of a particle moving in a one-dimensional lattice is a simple example of a Markov chain. The particle starts at the leftmost site and moves to the right, and the next state is determined by the current state and the position of the particle. The transition probabilities are given by the formula $P(x_{k+1} | x_k, y_k) = \\frac{1}{2}$, where $x_k$ and $y_k$ are the positions of the particle at time $k$ and the next time step, respectively.\n- The Markov chain of a traffic flow on a highway is another", "sft_answer": "Markov chains are a statistical model that describes the state transitions of a system. In this model, each state is associated with a probability distribution of possible next states. The probability of a state being reached at a later time is equal to the probability of reaching that state from the current state. In other words, the probability of reaching state $i$ at time $t$ is equal to the probability of reaching state $i$ at time $t$ from state $i-1$.\n\nThe Markov chain can be used to model a system's behavior in various ways. For example, a Markov chain can be used to model a continuous-time Markov chain, where the state transitions are continuous and independent of each other. This model is useful in situations where the system's state is continuously changing over time.\n\nIn the context of our example, a Markov chain could be used to model the state transitions of a stock market.
